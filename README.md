Assuming you have dashing installed, just cd into the project directory and type 'dashing start'.

Full documentation for [Dashing](http://dashing.io)


Retrieves request metrics etc from Spring Boot.  Note that the name of the metric is unique for each service endpoint so you will need to change spring-boot-actuator-metrics.rb for your own purposes.

There are two dashboars; ops includes a numebr of different metrics & ops1 is a minimal dashboard.

If you change jobs you need to restart dashing.  if you change styles etc. you just referesh the page (or it will re-render on next refresh).
